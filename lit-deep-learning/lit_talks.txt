Problem: How bring legal research into 21st century
Usual workflow: go to LawNet, search some stuff, string together info
Pain points
    1. Individual research workflow is inefficient
    2. Collaboration of legal research is difficult
    3. Knowledge retention and sharing

Tips
    - don't just focus on technical aspects
1. Validate your pain points and solution
    check with actual lawyers 
2. Perfect is the enemy of good - focus on key points
3. Sell the vision
    what looks good is not the final thing
    need to go beyond that and get the judge to see beyond what we created
    long-term roadmap + hide blemishes in current product bec not perfect
        they said tagging stuff makes it possible to use ML in the future

Q&A
1. Pitch & What the budges are looking for? Grill like a moot?
    Judges there to understand soln, not to see if handle pressure
    Asking qns cuz they are curious abt your soln

    Too innovative? 
        AI assistant writing documents and doing research. Got grilled presenting soln that was not really feasible, just screenshots without actl impl. If don't have the technology behind.
    
    If they ask qns it's cuz they are interested

2. Must it be implemented immediately?
    Definitely produce something working, even if not perfect. Easier to get vision and idea across. If you just have a flow on ppt, harder to see what you want to show. If have interface, let them experience the benefits you tout

    Even if ugly, as long as works.
