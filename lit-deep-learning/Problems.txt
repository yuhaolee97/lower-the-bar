Problems
    A. Volunteer Lawyers not allowed to recommend, independently find lawyers
    B. Restrictions / Limitations in seeing volunteer lawyers, waiting time
    C. AsiaLawNetwork is unapproachable and initimidating

Solutions / Unique Parts
    A. Recommender system for lawyers
    B. Needy can use our app if they dont qualify for volunteer lawyers
    C. Our app simulates an accessible, friendly

Unique parts to emphasize
    A. "LowerTheBar" to simulate accessible
        A1. AR => simulate exp
        A2. User can directly speak or write in layman terms and we can interpret what he is saying, 
            instead of having to fill up form (Speech recognition -> NLP)
    B. 

THings to do
    1. Front-end framework & find a template (React Native & ReactJS)
    2. AR / VR => need to integrate
    3. NLP => create the diagram and be confident about the data etc
    4. Form questions
        if able to get the info needed => no need questions
        otherwise, ask follow-up questions
    5. Evidence to show that AR/VR will make people open up more.
